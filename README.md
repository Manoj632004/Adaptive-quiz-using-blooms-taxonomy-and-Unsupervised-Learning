# BTL_Questionnaire_On_CS

## Overview
This project implements an intelligent quiz system that personalizes question delivery based on both Bloom’s Taxonomy Levels (BTL) and the learner’s difficulty preferences. The system dynamically filters and recommends questions using an unsupervised learning approach (Autoencoder-based reconstruction error) to approximate difficulty levels.
By combining educational theory with machine learning, this project demonstrates a practical system for adaptive learning. It can be extended to real-world educational platforms to enhance engagement, fairness, and personalization in assessments.

## Motivation 
Traditional quizzes and assessments often follow a one-size-fits-all approach. 
- Learners face the same set of questions regardless of their skill level, learning goals, or cognitive strengths.
- Difficulty is usually predefined by instructors, which introduces bias and lacks adaptability.

This creates a mismatch between a learner’s actual ability and the questions they receive, which can lead to disengagement, and lack of challenge.

The quiz system aims to:
- Personalize assessments by aligning questions with each learner’s comfort level across Bloom’s Taxonomy.
- Automate difficulty estimation using unsupervised machine learning (autoencoders), reducing reliance on manual labeling.
- Promote adaptive learning — ensuring learners are neither under-challenged nor overwhelmed
- Lay groundwork for scalable educational tools that could be integrated into e-learning platforms, tutoring systems, or exam preparation apps.
